# DiscoverCarApp

The world of technology has grown exponentially in the past few years, and with it, the possibilities for creativity have been pushed further and further. I am proud to share that I have recently created an application which uses both Python Langchain and OpenAI to help users find the right car for them based on some input variables.

The application uses a combination of Langchain.llms, OpenAI, Langchain.prompts, ImportPromptTemplate, and Streamlit to make the process simple and straightforward. The process is simple: users input their desired variables, and the application quickly pulls up the perfect car for 
them.

I am absolutely thrilled with the results of my work, and I am continuing to learn and grow as I explore the potential of this incredible technology. My application is just the beginning of what the possibilities are when you combine the power of Python, Langchain, and OpenAI.
